				<h1>Digital Computer</h1>
				<p>Konrad Zuse began work on Plankalkul (Plan Calculus), the first algorithmic programming language, with an aim of creating the theoretical preconditions for the formulation of problems of a general nature. Seven years earlier, Zuse had developed and built the world´s first binary digital computer, the Z1. He completed the first fully functional program-controlled electromechanical digital computer, the Z3, in 1941. Only the Z4 — the most sophisticated of his creations — survived World War II.</p>

			<li id="1930">
				<img src="img/1952.jpg" width="256" height="256" />
				<h1>First Compiler</h1>
				<p>Grace Hopper completes the A-0 Compiler. In 1952, mathematician Grace Hopper completed what is considered to be the first compiler, a program that allows a computer user to use English-like words instead of numbers. Other compilers based on A-0 followed: ARITH-MATIC, MATH-MATIC and FLOW-MATIC [software]</p>
			</li>
			<li id="1944">
				<img src="img/1962.jpg" width="256" height="256" />
				<h1>Games Started</h1>
				<p>MIT students Slug Russell, Shag Graetz, and Alan Kotok wrote SpaceWar!, considered the first interactive computer game. First played at MIT on DEC´s PDP-1, the large-scope display featured interactive, shoot´em-up graphics that inspired future video games. Dueling players fired at each other´s spaceships and used early versions of joysticks to manipulate away from the central gravitational force of a sun as well as from the enemy ship.</p>

			<li id="1950">
				<img src="image/4.png" width="256" height="256" />
				<h1>Computers for Kids</h1>
				<p>Seymour Papert designed LOGO as a computer language for children. Initially a drawing program, LOGO controlled the actions of a mechanical "turtle," which traced its path with pen on paper. Electronic turtles made their designs on a video display monitor.</p>
			</li>
			<li id="1971">
				<img src="img/1976.jpg" width="256" height="256" />
				<h1>New Operating System</h1>
				<p>Gary Kildall developed CP/M, an operating system for personal computers. Widely adopted, CP/M made it possible for one version of a program to run on a variety of computers built around eight-bit microprocessors.</p>
			</li>
			<li id="1977">
				<img src="img/1977.png" width="256" height="256" />
				<h1>IBM encryption</h1>
				<p>The U.S. government adopted IBM´s data encryption standard, the key to unlocking coded messages, to protect confidentiality within its agencies. Available to the general public as well, the standard required an eight-number key for scrambling and unscrambling data</p>
			</li>
			<li id="1989">
				<img src="img/1982.png" width="256" height="256" />
				<h1>Development of Lotus</h1>
				<p>Mitch Kapor developed Lotus 1-2-3, writing the software directly into the video system of the IBM PC. By bypassing DOS, it ran much faster than its competitors. Along with the immense popularity of the IBM´s computer, Lotus owed much of its success to its working combination of spreadsheet capabilities with graphics and data retrieval capabilities.</p>
			</li>
			<li id="1999">
				<img src="img/1983.png" width="256" height="256" />
				<h1>Word was announced</h1>
				<p>Microsoft announced Word, originally called Multi-Tool Word, and Windows. The latter doesn´t ship until 1985, although the company said it would be on track for an April 1984 release. In a marketing blitz, Microsoft distributed 450,000 disks demonstrating its Word program in the November issue of PC World magazine</p>
			</li>
			<li id="2001">
				<img src="img/1990.jpg" width="256" height="256" />
				<h1>Windows opened</h1>
				<p>Microsoft shipped Windows 3.0 on May 22. Compatible with DOS programs, the first successful version of Windows finally offered good enough performance to satisfy PC users. For the new version, Microsoft revamped the interface and created a design that allowed PCs to support large graphical applications for the first time. It also allowed multiple programs to run simultaneously on its Intel 80386 microprocessor.</p>
			</li>
			<li id="2011">
				<img src="img/1991.jpg" width="256" height="256" />
				<h1>Linux </h1>
				<p>Designed by Finnish university student Linus Torvalds, Linux was released to several Usenet newsgroups on September 17th, 1991. Almost immediately, enthusiasts began developing and improving Linux, such as adding support for peripherals and improving its stability. In February 1992, Linux became free software or (as its developers preferred to say after 1998) open source. Linux typically incorporated elements of the GNU operating system and became widely used.</p>

				<h3>Top 10 Most Important Software Programs</h3>
				<b>By John C. Dvorak</b>
				<p>I'm staying focused on my recent theme of best and worst this week. This column is devoted to identifying the top 10 software programs that were either the most successful or the most innovative in the modern era of desktop computing (1976 to the present). All of my thoughts here are debatable and if anyone wants to post an alternate list (with a rationale) using my basic criteria I'd be interested, and I'll try to link to all of the ideas on my Web log at www.dvorak.org.
				</p>
				<p>This list primarily highlights shrink wrap–type software rather than important protocols such as TCP/IP, Ethernet code or Postscript. The list also does not include ideas or concepts such as the Web or the Internet itself.
				</p>
				<p>I'm also not including embedded software sitting inside, say, a Cisco router. This sort of software will be discussed in a future top ten (or bottom 10) list. And finally, programming languages such as Fortran are not on the list since they predate what I consider modern computing and had no serious influence on the direction modern computing has taken.
				</p>
				<p>The only glaring omission might be AutoCAD. I left it off because AutoCAD, a professional LISP-centric tool, was never marketed in the spirit of the desktop revolution, but was sold as a very expensive design tool that just so happened to run on cheap computers. Its influence on the scene is negligible, so it's not listed.</p>
				<a class="showmore">show more</a>
				<div class="hide1">
				<p><b>10. Microsoft BASIC (1976)</b>--This was Microsoft's one true innovation that worked. Unlike its competitor of that era, Northstar BASIC, which was probably better-quality software, Microsoft sold its BASIC unbundled, and it was one of the first standalone boxed programming languages, if not the first. This software triggered the modern programming era and popularized the idea of shrink-wrap languages.</p>
				<p><b>9. Sendmail (circa 1983)</b>--This is the one criteria-challenged pick of this list, since it's kind of a protocol, but it's also a system supported by a company, Sendmail Inc., and is sort of a shrink-wrapped product without the shrink wrap. I had to include it on the list. Today's e-mail boom stems from the invention of this code.</p>
				<p><b>8. Aldus Pagemaker (1985)</b>--This is the program that sealed the deal for desktop publishing and the concept of WYSIWYG. It's the granddad of much of today's layout and design software. I'll also lump in its drawing partners Illustrator and Freehand.</p>
				<p><b>7. dBASE II (1980)</b>--A remarkable product in its day, and its influence lives on in all low-end commercial database software. It popularized the concept of a relational database manager, although it didn't quite follow all the parameters.</p>
				<p><b>6. Photoshop (1990)</b>--Over time the importance of this program to the development of small computers will increase. Used by professionals and amateurs alike, this software has influenced all its competition and has become very desirable.</p>
				<p><b>5. The Mac OS (1984)</b>—This OS and its Intel processor variant Windows 95 have to be on the list. The modern implementation of the graphical user interface was invented by Xerox, refined by Apple, and adopted by Microsoft. While Microsoft gets chided by me and others for copying the Apple/Xerox idea, there was probably no idea more worthy of being copied.</p>
				<p><b>4. The Mosaic browser (1993)</b>--This is the code that triggered the second desktop revolution, in combination with the World Wide Web. All modern browsers are based on many of the principles developed by Mosaic.</p>
				<p><b>3. Apache (1995)</b>—Apache and software from the open-source movement, including Linux and other initiatives, have to be included. This is a vague category where products are intermixed in a complex scene that encompasses the Internet and its transports. The fact is we would not be where we are today if it were not for the Linux/Apache Web servers. This powerful combination is now evolving into what users call LAMP (Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP), which seems to be a movement that will undermine the Microsoft .NET strategy. None of this could have happened without the Apache Web server software, which proved that open-source software can be reliable, stable, free, and definitive.</p>
				<p><b>2. WordStar (1978-1979)</b>—WordStar and its predecessor the Electric Pencil, as well as descendants such as Microsoft Word for Windows, have to be included. WordPerfect also deserves a mention here. But it was WordStar that really triggered things and became the first word processing killer app, dominating word processing for over a decade beginning with its release in the late 1970s. Word. You would not be reading this column if it wasn't for WordStar.</p>
				<p><b>1. VisiCalc (1979)</b>—VisiCalc and its descendants, including Lotus 1-2-3 and Microsoft Excel, were standout products. While fundamentally not as important as word processing, the modern spreadsheet, initially implemented on the Apple II, became the triggering mechanism that brought what was then called a microcomputer into the office. Almost all of the history of desktop computing stems from this invention.</p>
